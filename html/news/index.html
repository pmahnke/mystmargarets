<p>The <em>St Margarets Traders Association</em> has published a leaflet that will soon be distributed to local residents.  It highlights the Traders ideas for improving the high street without cost to the Council.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We love St Margarets and care that it retains its village atmosphere and unique identity. We don&#8217;t want St Margarets to become another faceless town dominated by the major multiples or allow it to deteriorate to an area plagued by unsightly and vacant shop units. The St Margarets Traders Association (SMTA) has been working hard to ensure that we promote and protect all that is special about St Margarets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Ideas include getting a fishmonger and a bakery and adding more retail space on St Margarets and Crown Roads.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/images/St_Margarets_plan.pdf">download and read the leaflet</a> [pdf]</p>

<ul>

<p><a href="http://www.mystmargarets.com/directory/estate_agent/201012150731">Churchills Estate Agents</a> of St Margarets would like to thank all the local residents for their support for the <a href="http://www.mystmargarets.com/directory/charity/200702020407">Lynn&#8217;s Bowel Cancer</a> Campaign Tombola at the St Margarets Christmas Fair in December.  We raised a very handsome sum for this great cause and we hope to continue this support into 2011. In turbulent economic times we feel it is important to help our fellow independent businesses and charities and every effort goes a long way.</p>


<p>The charm of St Margarets is most definitely defined by its resident&#8217;s village spirit and working together proves beneficial to all. With this is mind Churchills Estate Agents are donating 10% of our sales commissions to Lynn&#8217;s Bowel Cancer Campaign for all new properties for sale until the end of January 2011. With your ongoing support we will endeavour to continue this donation into Spring.</p>


<p>We anticipate a healthy growth of buyers drawn to St Margarets in 2011 and wish to share our success. Thank you again for all your support so far and we wish you a very prosperous 2011.</p>

<p>Following a letter received from Santa earlier this month, the St Margarets Traders Association have again agreed to help Santa and his trusty elves with the huge amount of post he receives from the boys and girls in the St Margarets area. Look-in Video in Crown Road, St Margarets, have one of Santa&#8217;s special North Pole post boxes so the boys and girls can post their letters to him, once posted the letters are wizzed to Santa (via Elf Airlines) who will reply to each letter. Look-In Video has appointed Mr. Jag as Santa&#8217;s Chief St Margarets Christmas Postmaster. Mr Jag&#8217;s job is to sort all of the replies from Santa and have them ready for the boys and girls to collect.</p>

<p>Since its introduction, the ecologically friendly shopping bag has not been absent from the St Margarets&#8217;s shopping streets.  Not only does the bag cleverly pay towards the beautiful Christmas street decorations and trees, making St Margarets local shopping all that more special, it also helps us St Margarets folk feel better about ourselves as we answer &#8220;no thanks&#8221; to those stores that continue to ask whether we would like a plastic bag to go along with our 2 purchased items&#8230;</p>
