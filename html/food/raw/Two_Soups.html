						&lt;p>&lt;em>both mushroom, but there’s a gag in there somewhere for fellow Julie Walters fans&#8230;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My favourite mushroom soup began life as a stuffed cabbage which, as opening gambits go, is going to require more explanation than most. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d intended to make &lt;a href="http://www.valentinewarner.com/" target="_blank">Valentine Warner&lt;/a>’s spectacular savoy cabbage stuffed with mushrooms, leeks, walnuts and stilton. It’s a vegetarian friendly dish so splendid that you might want to invite your non carnivorous friends over just for an excuse to make the blighter, assuming of course that you eat meat in the first place. As one of my guests on the night in question eschews red meat I was glad of the opportunity. Seriously, even if you don’t try these soups you must try &lt;a href="http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/632970" target="_blank">Val’s cabbage&lt;/a>. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it was one of those days. Time had completely run away with me in the kitchen and, even though I’d prepared the mushroom and leek component of the stuffing [PS - you'll need to do the same], when it came to preparing the cabbage the leaves all split on me. And you can’t make stuffed cabbage with a pile of shredded, tatty leaves. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>What was a boy to do? The close [though geographically distant] relatives were starving to death in the other room after a long drive, and were being ‘entertained’ by the Shopkeeper. Food was needed, and fast. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>As luck would have it there was double cream in the fridge and some decent vegetable bouillon powder in the cupboard. A good splash of dry sherry went into the mushroom pan and once almost evaporated was joined by half a litre of vegetable stock, 300ml of cream, and a bunch of thyme tied with string. After a few minutes of simmering, a very good dose of seasoning [as I think I’ve said before, cream dishes need plenty of seasoning], and a blitz with a stick blender – hey presto, soup! &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>NB – if you also need to do this quickly then don’t repeat my mistake and remember to remove the bunch of thyme tied with string before blending. Stick blenders, it turns out, don’t get on well with string [who knew?], and the time spent disentangling it and then passing the soup through a sieve causes further and entirely avoidable delay!&lt;/em> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst the above is not really time consuming [especially if you’re not in a flap at the time] what follows is even quicker and easier. I made it one day when working in &lt;a href="http://www.yellowwedge.com/" target="_blank">the shop&lt;/a> and with half an hour off to come up with some lunchtime sustenance for three hungry cheesemongers. This will make three decent sized mug-fulls. &lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>125g chestnut mushrooms, diced to your preferred size [mine is chunky, and they will shrink with cooking]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Garlic, crushed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rosemary, finely chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>500ml rich &lt;a href="http://wp.me/pYWFU-1N">chicken stock&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 tbsps double cream&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chilli sherry to finish [optional, but highly recommended]&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Fry the mushrooms in the oil over a relatively high heat and season with salt and black pepper. Once well coloured add the garlic and rosemary and cook for a couple of minutes more. Add the chicken stock and cream, bring back to the simmer and cook for five minutes. There is less cream here but you will still need to check and adjust the seasoning. Ladle into mugs and top with a splash of chilli sherry*, another marvel from Mr Warner. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>*Sorry but I can’t find a recipe for Valentine’s chilli sherry online, and I wouldn’t reproduce it without permission, so if you don’t already have it you’ll need to buy his &lt;a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1845335759/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_2?pf_rd_p=103612307&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=1845334507&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=1GZF2DTWH9K9312DYFTX#_" target="_blank">book&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>
&lt;/p>
