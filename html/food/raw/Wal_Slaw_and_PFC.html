h2. Flavour Saviour - Wal-Slaw and PFC

						&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whilst to some of my younger readers this will clearly mark me out as some sort of antediluvian anachronism, I can actually remember a Britain before McDonalds. The golden arches didn&#8217;t make it to our sceptred isle until 1974, fully 6 years after I first landed, and it would be many years more before Ronald showed his face in the provincial backwater that was my childhood home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="zem_slink" title="Colonel Sanders" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Sanders" rel="wikipedia">Colonel Sanders&lt;/a> on the other hand was quicker off the mark and &lt;a class="zem_slink" title="KFC" href="http://www.kfc.com/" rel="homepage">KFC&lt;/a> opened its first UK outlet in Preston in 1965. I don&#8217;t think the one I remember, a roadhouse style takeaway on Preston New Road, was the ground-breaker but it seemed always to have been there. We didn&#8217;t use it often – it was enough of a drive for the food to get cold before we got home, and being ‘foreign’ was clearly not intended for everyday consumption – but it was my first real introduction to the then exotic world of the fast food takeaway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps because of this childhood association fried chicken still holds a special place in my arteries, and is one of the few fast food staples that I might still crave before 2:00 a.m. and whilst stone cold sober. The colonel&#8217;s spice mix is of course as secret as the recipe for Coca Cola [apparently not even the factories who make it know the exact proportions, which I would have thought could prove to be a tad awkward, manufacturing-wise?] but it&#8217;s not actually that difficult to cook up a reasonable facsimile at home. Many of the myriad American recipes available online use frankly frightening amounts of MSG but even if this did figure in the Colonel&#8217;s own mysterious mix you don&#8217;t need it. Plenty of good old fashioned salt and pepper does the trick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course you can&#8217;t have fried chicken without some sort of slaw. When making this I had crunchy celery and apple to hand [as in a Waldorf Salad] and hey presto, Wal-Slaw was born! The sweet-corn is another classic fried chicken accompaniment so into the salad it went. A buttered baked potato finished off the finger lickin’ feast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Wal-Slaw&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Half a small red cabbage, finely shredded&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Half an apple, diced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A shallot, finely diced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One carrot, grated&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A small tin of sweet-corn kernels (not Colonels!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two sticks of celery, finely sliced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The juice of half a lemon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A splash of malt vinegar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sufficient mayonnaise to bind&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>First dice the apple and toss in the lemon juice and vinegar. Then just throw everything else in and stir in the mayonnaise to your liking. Season and chill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Philip&#8217;s Fried Chicken [PFC]&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>6 chicken thighs, bone in and skin on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 tbsps plain flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 soupspoon cornflour [optional]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 medium eggs, beaten&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tsps salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tsps ground black pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tsp paprika&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp garlic powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp celery salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp dried thyme&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp dried oregano&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 stick of celery broken into four [optional]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vegetable oil for frying&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Soak the chicken thighs in the beaten egg and allow them to wallow for a while. Place the flour [and cornflour if using], seasoning and spices into a zip-lock plastic bag and shake well to combine. Throw the chicken pieces into the spiced flour, zip up the bag and shake well to coat them evenly. Rest the whole lot in the fridge for a few minutes whilst you heat up the oil and shake again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a heavy, lidded skillet or frying pan heat about half an inch of vegetable oil. The depth needs to be such that once the chicken is in the oil will not reach higher than half way up the side of the pan. To see when the oil is hot enough for frying insert the handle of a wooden spoon – when the oil forms lively bubbles around the handle you’re ready to go [NB very vigorous bubbling means the oil is too hot, allow it to cool a little and try again]. Using tongs gently place the chicken pieces into the oil, skin side down, and add the celery pieces if using – it may be an old wives&#8217; tale but this is supposed to help to crisp the chicken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cover and cook for nine to ten minutes, checking from time to time that the underside isn’t browning too quickly – if it is, lower the heat. Again using tongs turn the pieces and cook for another nine to ten minutes but this time without the lid. When all the chicken pieces are beautifully golden brown all over remove from the oil and drain. Some say this is best done on brown paper such as a grocer’s bag but kitchen roll will do too. Let the chicken cool for a few minutes before you dig in to avoid southern fried lips, a less appealing dish by far.
&lt;/p>
