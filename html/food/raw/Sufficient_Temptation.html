h2. Flavour Saviour - Sufficient Temptation

						&lt;p>&lt;em>Sorry &#8211; couldn&#8217;t wait!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have always known this as a recipe for Jansonn&#8217;s Temptation, a dish so delicious as to have allegedly made the eponymous Mr Jansonn renounce his vow to give up earthly pleasures, hence the name. But it would seem not. My research tells me that the Swedish original is not made with anchovies [as here] but with pickled sprats, and apparently the genuine article has a crunchy breadcrumb topping, which this doesn&#8217;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No matter. Whatever this is it is certainly tempting enough for me – as you can see I couldn’t even wait for my camera to recharge before digging in. It eats beautifully with lamb, but this one partnered first some pan fried rainbow trout fillets and then some braised duck legs the next day. And in the absence of any of the above I’d happily eat it on its own, on my own, with the lights off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple recipe like this is just the sort of thing to tempt me to tinker and tweak – some garlic perhaps, or maybe a bit of grated gruyere? Take it from me, I have tried, and there is no need. There’s a beauty in the simplicity which does not need to compete with extraneous embellishments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And in the unlikely event that you find me on the verge of renouncing earthly pleasures, do me a favour and rustle up a batch will you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Whilst this could probably feed two to four as a side dish you may well begrudge sharing it with anyone else&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>500g waxy potatoes cut into fine juliennes [see below]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A 50g tin of anchovies in olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 medium onion, finely sliced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>150ml double cream&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>First peel the potatoes and cut into fine matchsticks about 2 or 3mm square. A mandolin with the right attachments will help but do be careful with your fingers and use a guard – you will have noticed that chef’s blood is not listed in the ingredients above and in almost all cases it is an unwelcome addition to a dish. Leave your matchstick juliennes to soak in cold water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drain the oil from the anchovies into a pan, place on a medium heat and soften the onions in the oil. Chop / mince the anchovies and add to the onions – they will disappear into mix as they cook. Drain the potatoes and add to the pan, giving them a stir for  a couple minutes to warm, soften slightly and absorb the flavours going on around them. Pour in the cream and do the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tip all into a gratin dish, season with black pepper and pop into a 180˚C oven for half an hour. Check from time to time and if burning on top cover with foil. If after thirty minutes the potatoes don’t yield to a sharp knife give it a few minutes extra. The top should be browned and slightly crispy, the innards soft, moist and frankly heavenly.
&lt;/p>
