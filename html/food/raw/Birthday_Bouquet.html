&lt;p>When you live in or around London there seems to be no bigger a challenge than getting from one side of it to the other. You pick your compass point [I’ve done them all over the years] and can normally manage to make it from there to the centre and back, but god forbid you should be forced to make the tortuous schlep &lt;em>across&lt;/em> town. We’ve got friends in Switzerland we see more often than those round the South Circular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I was surprised and delighted when the lovely Lucie and Lucas trekked all the way from Camberwell for my recent birthday drinks in St Margarets! I daren’t even check the details on the &lt;a href="http://journeyplanner.tfl.gov.uk/user/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en" target="_blank">Transport for London Journey Planner&lt;/a> for fear that the sheer number of connections and modes of transport will crash the site permanently. But arrive they did, both beaming broadly and bearing a fragrant birthday bouquet – of wild garlic! Lucas had been in Somerset that morning [the boy clearly likes to get about] and had been so excited to see such an early crop that he must have denuded an entire forest floor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wild garlic is excellent forager’s food being easy to identify, difficult to confuse with anything dangerous, and abundant. And in this age of austerity free foraged food can only be a good thing. When walking in the woods keep a nostril open for the perfume of garlic, then look for the spear shaped leaves, similar to lily of the valley.  Just don’t forget to give it a wash when you get home – you know what bears [and other more common quadrupeds] do in woods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then use it, well, just about everywhere and anywhere. This week so far it’s been popping up in soups, salads, sauces, and mashed potato [let it infuse in warm milk or cream], and there’s a pesto still to come. But I think my favourite was a simple omelette, topped with chopped wild garlic while the egg still ran, some Somerset cheddar [in case it was feeling homesick], a good grind of black pepper and finished under the grill. Eggs, cheese and sweet, sweet garlic – I don’t know what it’s like for you reading that list but I can’t write it without salivating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much tastier than a bunch of tulips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;/p>
