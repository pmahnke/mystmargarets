Flavour Saviour - Wallpaper* Duck

&lt;p>It will come as either a great disappointment or a huge relief to discover that this recipe does not in fact contain any wallpaper. Duck yes, Sanderson print or Anaglypta no. The name comes from the fact that I have based this on one which appeared in the launch issue of Wallpaper* Magazine way back in 1996.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Tyler Brûlé’s original style bible first hit the newsstands I was one of the salivating fashionistas desperately drooling over the dreamily hip lifestyle portrayed within its pages. The editor&#8217;s eye for a handsome male model [first time I’d seen two pretty boys cavorting in an expensive hotel pool for a mainstream magazine travel piece!] certainly didn’t hurt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fifteen years on it’s interesting to see what has and hasn’t changed in the world of über-cool lifestyle publishing. In the &lt;em>resources&lt;/em> section of the launch issue not a single supplier lists a ‘website’, and the London phone numbers begin with either 0171 or 0181 [not many of the latter though!]. But you could take just about any of the pieces devoted to beautiful people wearing beautiful clothes and surrounded by beautiful stuff and drop them into a magazine tomorrow and I swear no-one would bat a perfectly mascara-ed eyelid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that has certainly endured through the years for me though is my somewhat re-calibrated version of this dish. Perhaps it’s just a sign of the ever increasing speed with which the fashion wheel spins that when I make this roughly two or three times a year it now probably counts as a ‘revival’! The original came from a piece about how we trendy young things were reclaiming and re-inventing Sunday lunch, and even came with a playlist. Whatever day you choose to serve it, just don’t forget to be ravishingly beautiful when you do…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>For two, though there may be some leftover sauce to play with&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 duck legs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tbsp groundnut oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 cloves garlic, chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3cm ginger, peeled and finely chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>150ml light chicken stock&lt;/li>
&lt;li>200ml red wine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>50ml Japanese soy sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chinese five spice powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 soupspoons runny honey&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 whole star anise&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Preheat your oven to 180˚C. In a heavy lidded casserole on a highish heat brown the duck legs all over and season them with salt and pepper as you go, then remove them from the pot and the pot from the heat, and pour off all but a scant tablespoonful of the fat which will have been rendered from the duck [excess duck fat can be saved and used later for roast potatoes]. Pop this back onto a gentle heat and sauté the garlic and ginger until softened but not coloured. Add all the liquids and simmer for five minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Smear the browned duck legs with the five spice powder and return them to the pan. The liquid should come to no higher than halfway up the legs, and if scaling up this recipe keep the proportions the same but only add enough liquor to reach the same height in your pan. Drizzle a soupspoon of honey over each leg and top it with a star anise. Cover and give this an hour and fifteen minutes in the oven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whack the oven up to 230˚C, remove the duck from the sauce and place them back in the oven [on a tray] to crisp up the skin a little. Meanwhile strain the sauce into a pan and reduce gently. You can thicken this with cornflour, or glaze and emulsify with a little chilled butter if you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to serve this with moulded rings of twice-baked potato [coming soon!] and simply steamed pack-choi, the irony bitterness of the greens being a great foil for the very rich sauce. But this week it was asparagus as I’m eating it just about every day before the season ends.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>There are uses for any leftover sauce and options with the potato which we will return to at a later stage&#8230;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/p>
