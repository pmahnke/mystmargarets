						&lt;p>&lt;em>OK, they might sound a tad unconventional at first, but I&#8217;m sharing one of my best kept secrets here, and after their first appearance I guarantee that you&#8217;ll be asked to make them again [and again...]&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My “full English breakfast on a stick” was invented over a dozen years ago when I was asked to help cater the 30th birthday party of an old friend. His then partner (now wife) didn&#8217;t share his fondness for baked beans and I was tasked with devising a comestible Trojan horse to sneak them into the feast. Deciding that a canapé can cover a multitude of sins I set about hatching my egg and beans plot, and now it&#8217;s become my drinks party must have. Besides, if a full English breakfast is such a good hangover cure, surely there must be some preventative benefit to be gained by eating one &lt;em>with&lt;/em> your cocktails?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This canapé essentially consists of a &#8216;fried bread&#8217; crouton with a layer of baked beans, a slice of sausage, a dollop of ketchup and a boiled quails egg. Allow 2 or 3 per guest &#8211; once over the initial shock they&#8217;ll be back for more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You will need&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sliced white bread [this can be as cheap as you like, but everything else should be the best you can buy]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Good pork sausages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Baked beans [would you use anything other than Heinz?]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tomato ketchup [see above]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Quail’s eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>First grill the sausages and allow to cool. Each will probably yield about 7 or 8 slices around the thickness of a £1 coin. Simmer the baked beans for a few minutes, all the better if a few break up, and allow these to cool too. This thickens the sauce and makes it much easier to perch a few beans on each crouton.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cut small circles from slices of the bread with a pastry cutter or liqueur glass and slather them with olive oil. You will get between 6 and 9 croutons from each slice depending on the size of the loaf. Spread out evenly on a baking sheet and cook in a 180˚C oven for about 10 minutes until golden and crunchy, but do keep an eye on them &#8211; one minute they&#8217;re golden brown and the next they&#8217;re charcoal! Drain on kitchen paper and allow to cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For years I cooked my own quails eggs and laboriously shelled them, which is easier if you roll the egg between your palm and a hard surface to crack the shell, and then peel under a running tap. Now I buy them ready cooked and peeled and suggest you do the same. It saves hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pour some tomato ketchup into a small bowl, arm yourself with a couple of teaspoons and some cocktail sticks, and you&#8217;re ready to assemble. First top each crouton with a few beans using a teaspoon. Then balance a sausage slice on each. Next use the other teaspoon to dab on a blob of ketchup. Skewer an egg with a cocktail stick and push the bottom of the stick through the middle of the canapé, squishing the egg into its ketchupy cushion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And voila, full English breakfast on a stick! Even if it looks slightly daunting at first the whole thing should be taken in one mouthful to be best appreciated. Recently a four year old guest of mine managed it [several times!] so I&#8217;m sure you can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with most canapés the best way to present these is in repeating rows – they look particularly good on a black slate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Shopkeeper has always been egg-averse, which somewhat lessens his enjoyment of this otherwise remarkable morsel. If you find yourself with similarly afflicted guests then a quarter of a mushroom sautéed with garlic and rosemary can stand in for the egg. &lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;/p>
