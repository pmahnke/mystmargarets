&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was one of those times when the dish in question became the happier accidental cousin of the meal before. The pheasant was cooked as a tribute to the unforgettable River Cafe&#8217;s Rose Gray when she died in 2010. But pleasant as the original dish was, I don&#8217;t have wood fired oven in my kitchen, and I don&#8217;t have Rose&#8217;s magic in my finger tips. So having served the breasts according to the original recipe, I made this using the leg meat and carcass pickings from a large bird [a small whole bird will easily yield enough meat for two people]. I&#8217;m giving no precise measurements here other than to say that you should use 1 large egg for each 100g type 00 flour for your pasta dough. Beyond that it&#8217;s a case of let go and follow your instincts, they&#8217;re invariably right, as I&#8217;m sure Rose would agree&#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the meat from the cooked bird and chop finely – the flavour of pheasant is potent and a little goes a long way. Use the carcass to make a stock with some onion, carrot and celery, a bouquet garni of thyme, parsley, bay and marjoram, and few crushed juniper berries. Soak a handful of raisins in a large wine glass of ruby port. Mash a squashy ball of &lt;a title="Homemade Mozzarella" href="http://whatsforteatonightdear.wordpress.com/2011/09/18/homemade-mozzarella/" target="_blank"&gt;Mozzarella&lt;/a&gt; with a fork and add the chopped meat and the raisins. Reduce the stock to a few tablespoons, throw in the port from the raisins and reduce again. Whilst the reduction reduces roll your pasta dough out to the thinnest setting on your machine, and make your ravioli using a&lt;br /&gt;
rounded teaspoon of the filling in each. Add enough cream or &lt;em&gt;crème fraiche&lt;/em&gt; to your reduced sauce to quadruple its volume along with a teaspoon of good grain mustard and adjust the seasoning. The ravioli are cooked when the water returns to the boil and they float to the surface. Transfer them to warmed plates and drizzle sparingly with olive oil, then liberally with the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
