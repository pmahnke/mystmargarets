						<br />
<p>Once upon a time, probably around 18 years ago, I remember picking up a recipe card in a supermarket after seeing the recipe advertised on <span class="caps">TV.</span> This was a cutting edge piece of marketing in the early nineties, before we all had inter-lives and tweet-nests and books full of faces through which companies could court our affections. Not sure if this marks me out as an early adopter or a sheep, but it worked.</p>
<p>What now looks like an essentially simple dish felt like quite a complex &#8216;occasion&#8217; piece at the time, but that&#8217;s probably due to my relative culinary inexperience, the use of the then uncommon &#8216;Mascarpone&#8217; [daring!], and the flim-flamerous decoration required by the original recipe. The smiley people in the TV advert easily made chocolate leaves and sugared their grapes for the topping, but it was always a bit more of a palaver in my kitchen.</p>

<p>Well blow me down, but a whole year has gone by since my first post on Independence Day 2010 [so Happy Birthday to America too while we&#8217;re about it]. I really had no idea what to expect when I started all this, but to the thousands of visitors I&#8217;ve now welcomed along the way I&#8217;d like to say a huge thank you for your support during my first year in the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Looking back I find that I&#8217;m clearly more interested in purple foods than I ever realised [I&#8217;m going to have to add that as a tag now!] and a quick glance at the tag cloud over to the right tells me that garlic, cream, eggs and butter are frequently featured. A quick glance at my waistline could probably have told me the same.</p>

						<br />
<p>It will come as either a great disappointment or a huge relief to discover that this recipe does not in fact contain any wallpaper. Duck yes, Sanderson print or Anaglypta no. The name comes from the fact that I have based this on one which appeared in the launch issue of Wallpaper* Magazine way back in 1996.</p>

<p>When Tyler Brûlé&#8217;s original style bible first hit the newsstands I was one of the salivating fashionistas desperately drooling over the dreamily hip lifestyle portrayed within its pages. The editor&#8217;s eye for a handsome male model [first time I&#8217;d seen two pretty boys cavorting in an expensive hotel pool for a mainstream magazine travel piece!] certainly didn&#8217;t hurt.</p>

						<p><em>both mushroom, but there&#8217;s a gag in there somewhere for fellow Julie Walters fans&#8230;</em></p>

<p>My favourite mushroom soup began life as a stuffed cabbage which, as opening gambits go, is going to require more explanation than most. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d intended to make <a href="http://www.valentinewarner.com/" target="_blank">Valentine Warner</a>&#8217;s spectacular savoy cabbage stuffed with mushrooms, leeks, walnuts and stilton. It&#8217;s a vegetarian friendly dish so splendid that you might want to invite your non carnivorous friends over just for an excuse to make the blighter, assuming of course that you eat meat in the first place. As one of my guests on the night in question eschews red meat I was glad of the opportunity. Seriously, even if you don&#8217;t try these soups you must try <a href="http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/632970" target="_blank">Val&#8217;s cabbage</a>. </p>

<p>My &#8220;full English breakfast on a stick&#8221; was invented over a dozen years ago when I was asked to help cater the 30th birthday party of an old friend. His then partner (now wife) didn&#8217;t share his fondness for baked beans and I was tasked with devising a comestible Trojan horse to sneak them into the feast. Deciding that a canapé can cover a multitude of sins I set about hatching my egg and beans plot, and now it&#8217;s become my drinks party must have. Besides, if a full English breakfast is such a good hangover cure, surely there must be some preventative benefit to be gained by eating one <em>with</em> your cocktails?</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the unseasonably warm and sunny weather we&#8217;ve been enjoying of late, or maybe it&#8217;s got something to do with my having done two whole weeks of full-time work [I know, poor me!], but I&#8217;m yearning to get on a plane and head for distant shores. And with my own planned odyssey to explore the food of Indochina currently on indefinite hold it doesn&#8217;t help that you can&#8217;t turn on the TV at the moment without seeing a certain bum-chinned, potty-mouthed chef trampling all over South East Asia and its peoples and cuisines. Ah well, if departure lounges must remain a distant dream for now there&#8217;s nothing to stop me rustling up a mini-break from the comfort of my own kitchen.</p>

<p><em>Not a republican call to arms, but time to celebrate the start of this year&#8217;s Jersey Royal season!</em></p>

<p>A few years ago we were lucky enough to be visiting friends in Jersey in early March, and driving round the island on a gloriously sunny Sunday we found the first Jersey Royals of the season for sale in a farmer&#8217;s &#8216;honesty shop&#8217;, a shed full of produce with a box for you to leave your payment. I was as excited as a Yukon gold miner and dashing home with them felt like being on the old Beaujolais Nouveau run [does anyone else remember when that actually used to make the 6 o&#8217;clock <span class="caps">BBC </span>news?]. It being the Shopkeeper&#8217;s birthday we were due to meet friends at the local bistro for dinner, and my breathless call on landing at Gatwick was the first, and so far only, time I have phoned ahead to a restaurant to ask if the kitchen would mind if we were to bring our own potatoes! I can only hope that if it happens again our hosts will be as accommodating as <a href="http://www.brula.co.uk/" target="_blank">Brula</a> were that evening.</p>

						<p><em>Sorry - couldn&#8217;t wait!</em></p>

<p>I have always known this as a recipe for Jansonn&#8217;s Temptation, a dish so delicious as to have allegedly made the eponymous Mr Jansonn renounce his vow to give up earthly pleasures, hence the name. But it would seem not. My research tells me that the Swedish original is not made with anchovies [as here] but with pickled sprats, and apparently the genuine article has a crunchy breadcrumb topping, which this doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>February means it&#8217;s time to toast the short Seville orange season again and even if you haven&#8217;t been making your own marmalade chances are that somebody you know has. Whether you have a glut or not, don&#8217;t make it the exclusive preserve of the breakfast table. The bitterness of the <em>bigarade</em> [as the French call Seville oranges] brings an added dimension to otherwise sweet dishes.</p>
<p>A partially shared Scottish heritage might explain the long affinity of marmalade and whisky- it&#8217;s not uncommon to find marmalade with whisky in it, but you can also turn the combination on its head and add a dollop of marmalade to a whisky cocktail. So if you have some whisky marmalade lurking in the cupboard this is the place to use it. I used brioche this time but the beauty of bread and butter pudding is that you can use any old bread, one or two days old being best.</p>

<p><em>Happy New Year to everyone celebrating the Spring Festival - may the year of the rabbit bring you prosperity, happiness and good health.</em></p>
<p>Learning a language as an adult is far more difficult than doing so as a child when the relevant bits of our brains are more plastic, malleable and hungry for linguistic stimuli. And as it is with language, so with tableware. I could read English by the time I went to nursery school, but I didn&#8217;t meet my first pair of chopsticks until I was in my twenties. By then I could speak knife and fork with ease, and could happily conjugate the correct cutlery course combinations for soup, fish, cheese etc. But my adult mind has never mastered more than a rudimentary grasp of chopsticks. My fingers lack fluency, and even when I do successfully manage to convey a morsel of food to my mouth I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s done with a thick English accent, clearly audible to anyone within spitting distance whose mother tongue is chopsticks.</p>

<p>So &#8212; September&#8217;s here. The Indian summer begins to wane and as we roll into autumn I can&#8217;t entirely agree with Keats. The mists are here on Marble Hill Park, and yes the shelves of Streets the grocers are groaning with the orchards&#8217; fruitfulness, but this change of season is never a mellow time for the Food-Phile&#8230;</p>
